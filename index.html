  <lecture-slide title="HAX: Wordpress Killer" presenter="Bryan Ollendyke">
    <p>HAX is a visual web builder for producing content in a “forever” format known as HTML, 
      with a wrinkle. Imagine being able to reprogram the <strong>strong</strong> tag. While silly, this would 
      fundamentally change the way you build and develop everything on the web. When we describe HTML as 
      forever, it’s because the HAX platform is literally a <strong>h-a-x</strong> tag in the browser that we can reprogram 
      after initial implementation. This means courses written in HAX 5 years ago, never touched by faculty,
      leveraging advanced JS and CSS yet never known about by faculty, are more accessible, higher in usability,
      load faster, and are easier to use by students with 0 additional effort by faculty or staff.
